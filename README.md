# Little React projects with John Smilga
These are short projects I wrote under the guidance of John Smilga's <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/react-tutorial-and-projects-course/?referralCode=FEE6A921AF07E2563CEF"> react course </a> where CSS styles were provided. Too see his original projects online please navigate <a href="https://react-projects.netlify.app/">here</a> (basic projects/course exlusive) or download a single directory and go with: <br />
<code>npm install</code><br />
<code>npm start</code>
